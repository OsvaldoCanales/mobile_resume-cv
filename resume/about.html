        <h1> About Me </h1>
        <p> Hello my name is Osvaldo Canales. I am currently working as a 
            junior software engineer at Parsons Corporations. Outside of work and school 
            I like to play video games and workout. I am looking into new skills and 
            hobbies like badminton or pickleball. Let me know if you have any recommendations!
        </p>
